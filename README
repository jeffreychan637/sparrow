How To Build, Run, and Test Sparrow:

1. Import the tarball into Android Studio.
2. Under the "Run" menu, click run to build and run the app on your connected
   physical devices.
3. To test and check out Sparrow, simply create a tweet (tap the plus button)
   and watch as it travels from one phone to another. To test advanced
   features, go into the settings menu. (You can open the various menu
   screens available by hitting the dots in the upper right corner)

A Note on Design and Extra Features
Within our implementation of BASIC, our devices are constantly either listening
for other devices as a server or connecting to local devices just discovered
as clients. All of this runs in the background without any user intervention
besides occasional popups to make the device discoverable to other devices
in the area (In fact, it would only take one more line of code to have to
only ever ask the user once to make device discoverable and never show
another dialog, but we felt battery life was more important here).

As our extra features, we tried to implement both encryption and BLE. In
regards to BLE, the code is almost all there and it theoretically should work,
but in practice, it does not work (There are issues with getting the
peripheral device to respond with services available). We'd be happy to talk
more about this, but this is just so you know that we tried our best on BLE,
but it technically does not work, although we do believe we're just a bug or
two away from getting it to work. We understand that there's no way we should
get full credit for our implementation of BLE, but given that it is mostly there
and that we pretty much implemented BASIC with no user intervention, we would
really appreciate consideration for partial credit for the work put in.
